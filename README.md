# CNN filters category selectivity

This project helps to understand a CNN's properties: 

- which layer contains filters sensitive to a certain category
- what kind of image categories activate particular filter
- which layer to choose for latent feature extraction for a given category

VGG16 from `keras.applications` is used as a CNN model.
